## Welcome to Fast Help 👷🏽

Fast Help is built to serve as a quick reference guide for deep learning and is targeted at practitioners who are new to the field. 

I add content as and when I learn something new and incorporate into my toolkit. 

I draw on approaches, techniques, code snippets, technical documenentation and lessons from the following sources. I am indebted to their generosity for making deep learning accessible to so many. 

- [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) taught by Jeremy Howard
- [Applied ML in Production](https://madewithml.com/courses/applied-ml-in-production/) taught by Goku Mohandas
- [Practical Data Ethics](https://ethics.fast.ai/) taught by Rachel Thomas
- [PyTorch Tutorials - Complete Beginner Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMXfZB8FVUA&list=PLqnslRFeH2UrcDBWF5mfPGpqQDSta6VK4) taught by Patrick Loeber
