## Welcome to Fast Help

This website is intended to be used as a quick reference guide for deep learning and is targeted at practitioners who are new to the field. 

I primarily draw on approaches, techniques, code snippets, technical documenentation and lessons from the following sources. 

- [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) taught by Jeremy Howard
- [Applied ML in Production](https://madewithml.com/courses/applied-ml-in-production/) taught by Goku Mohandas
- [Practical Data Ethics](https://ethics.fast.ai/) taught by Rachel Thomas
- [PyTorch Tutorials - Complete Beginner Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMXfZB8FVUA&list=PLqnslRFeH2UrcDBWF5mfPGpqQDSta6VK4) taught by Patrick Loeber
- [fastai](https://docs.fast.ai/) documentation
- [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) documentation


You can navigate to specific topics via

- Navigation menu 

- Search bar




You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/adiswami/website/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/adiswami/website/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
