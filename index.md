## Welcome to Fast Help

Fast Help is built to serve as a quick reference guide for deep learning and is targeted at practitioners who are new to the field. 

I add content as and when I learn something new and incorporate into my toolkit. 

Content is one of these stages.

🧘🏽‍♂️ Not Started → 👷🏽 In Progress→ 🎉 Completed

🎉 **Completed**
Content that is more or less complete.


👷🏽 **In Progress**
Content that is undergoing major edits.


🧘🏽‍♂️ **Not Started**
Content that is in the pipeline.


I draw on approaches, techniques, code snippets, technical documenentation and lessons from the following sources. I am indebted to their generosity for making deep learning accessible to so many.
